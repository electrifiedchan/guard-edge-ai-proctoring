/**
 * Plain-language decoder for every dashboard chart.
 *
 * The panels render real telemetry, but a sparkline of "composure" or a ring
 * marked 62 means nothing without being told what it measures and what good
 * looks like. Rather than crowd each panel with permanent caption text, the
 * copy lives here and Panel reveals it on demand behind a "?".
 *
 * Numbers quoted below must track the engine:
 *   - readiness bands  → backend/core_memory/timeline.py::_readiness_band
 *   - talking band     → TALKING_BAND in @/lib/dashboard
 *   - gaze buckets     → the engine's STRAIGHT | SIDE_OR_UP | DOWN states
 * If those move and these don't, the dashboard starts lying confidently.
