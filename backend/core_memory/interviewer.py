# Reasoning models (gpt-oss-20b on both NVIDIA and Groq) spend completion tokens
# on a hidden reasoning trace BEFORE they emit a single visible character. At the
# old cap of 600 the trace consumed the entire budget: finish_reason came back
# "length", `content` came back None, extract_json failed, and every session
# silently fell through to _backup_questions() — which is why the interviewer
# sounded generic and never named a project. llama-3.1-8b hid this for a year
# because it had no trace and spent all 600 tokens on the answer itself.
# Measured: ~560 completion tokens for a 4-question plan, so this leaves room.

Read this candidate's resume and write exactly 4 questions that could ONLY be asked of THIS candidate.

Candidate Resume:
{resume_text[:4000]}

Rules for every question:
- Name something concrete from the resume out loud — the project, product, company, library, or a number they shipped.
- Dig into the decisions behind that specific work: what broke, what they traded away, what the result actually was.
- Still get at situation -> action -> result, but anchored to their real work, never as a template.
- Never write a question you could paste into a different candidate's interview.
- One or two sentences. No preamble, no "tell me about a time" boilerplate.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with a "questions" array. Format:
{{
  "questions": [
    {{"question": "On [project named in the resume] you went with [specific choice they made] - what broke first, and what did you give up to fix it?", "focus": "System Design"}},
    ...
  ]
}}
Replace the bracketed parts with real details from the resume above.
Do not include markdown blocks, pleasantries, or extra text. Just the JSON object."""
